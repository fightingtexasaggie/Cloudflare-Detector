Requires: nodejs v20.19+
I built on Fedora 42, but this should be fairly portable. Be warned,
this is my first attempt at a browser extension.

To build extension:
npm install
npm run build

At this point, you should be able to open your Chromium/Chrome
browser's extension dialog (chrome://extensions/), put it in
Developer mode (sorry, this is still pretty raw), then use the
"Load Unpacked" to load the module from the freshly-created
dist directory.

Pin the extension icon to the browser bar so you can see
it change to red when a cloudflare site is detected.

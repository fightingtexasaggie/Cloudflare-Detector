Cloudflare is quickly becoming an absolute necessity in dealing with the hoards of
ill-behaved AI training bots that will drive your server loads through the roof,
and in come cases act like a distributed denial-of-service attack, especially
when caught in login loops, or when traversing high-cpu expense routes you may
have exposed. Cloudflare offers a DNS-level mitigation service that effectively
blocks these bots as well as intentionally malicious traffic, and they offer
most of this service for free.

The way Cloudflare works is that in order to use them, you set them up as your
DNS provider for your domain, then Cloudflare servers place themselves in the
path between your server and your end users. It works well, and because Cloudflare
controls your DNS, it can re-issue SSL certificates using Google Security Services
and LetsEncrypt on your behalf. The SSL certificate on your server is not the
certificate end users will see. This places Cloudflare in a position to see
all your https encrypted traffic.

I wrote this extension to alert me when I'm on a site that's using Cloudflare.

This extension is a work in progress, so it's best to build it yourself using
the instructions provided in the BUILDING.txt file. For now, all this extension
does is turn its own icon red when it encounters Cloudflare. It also puts URL
details on the service worker's console log, which I'll probably turn into a counter
on the icon at some point.
